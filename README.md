# Narration

A basic engine for narration via text in the browser.

Includes functionality to simultaneously show text and let it be spoken.

An example can be found in `index.js` (together with `index.html`).

[Demo (with spoken text, works in Google Chrome)](https://sanjosolutions.github.io/narration/)
